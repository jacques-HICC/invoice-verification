## TODO.md
- ~~Next prev buttons nowhere to be found for specific invoice pages~~
- ~~Toronto waterfront often coming out as "company name" even though this is the name of the project -> adjust prompt~~
- ~~Grab credentials from UI on app start instead of in console~~
- Package everything so it's downloadable and runnable from devops or github ie setup.bat, start_app.bat
- Add "Processed with" field to sharepoint tracker that could show which model was used - would support model testing
- ~~Resizable mock-console~~
- ~~Zoom/pan invoice preview~~
- ~~Delete stuff from /temp on app startup~~
- Delete jpg files from /temp on save&next
- Make gcdocs folder changeable in the UI
- Make n_ctx a variable in the interface as well (maybe low ram, medium and high settings)
- Skip button for previewer to skip an invoice
- ~~Gcdocs link button for previewer~~
- Keyboard shortcuts for validation workflow
- Overlay preview section for loading
- Some function for "not an invoice" in previewer.. Maybe tie this to additional SharePoint field so we ignore it in training and subsequent runs
- Make mock console logs cooler looking
- ~~Make mock console scrollable~~
- Make button to go to sharepoint list
- Back button to edit sharepoint list
- Log ocr text to gcdocs training folder
- ~~Swap to paddleOCR~~
- Include few-shot examples in prompt (fictitious data, obfuscated because it will be in devops/git repo)
- Keep model in memory (don't reinitialize it every run)
- Resizing the mock console seems broken
- ~~Killswitch for AI processing~~
- ~~move css outside index.html~~
- ~~move scripts outside index.html~~
